#### 👋 Hi there, I'm Roble, a Cloud Computing Engineer with a passion for building and managing scalable, reliable infrastructure.

Based on my experience with AWS services and the ability to manage them effectively, I am proficient in services such as CloudWatch, Amazon S3, RDS, VPC, EC2, IAM users and roles, Lambda, and Amazon EventBridge. I also have experience deploying and managing infrastructure using HashiCorp Terraform and Jenkins. With Terraform, I can write complete infrastructure configurations, applying the landing zone accelerator approach. This facilitates the adoption of new infrastructure and migration to the cloud with minimal time required, making it production-ready. Terraform also helps manage infrastructure as code to avoid manual configuration and enables scaling of infrastructure. 

In addition to my technical skills, I am well-versed in Agile methodologies and use tools like Jira to manage and track tasks and projects. I understand the importance of clear and concise documentation and use Confluence to document processes and procedures. This ensures that all team members have a clear understanding of what needs to be done, how it needs to be done, and when it needs to be done.

I also use draw.io to create AWS architecture diagrams, which helps me visualize and communicate infrastructure design and dependencies to team members and stakeholders. This improves team efficiency and ensures that projects are delivered on time, within budget, and to the highest quality. I believe that good documentation, Agile methodologies, and visualization tools like draw.io are key to delivering successful projects, and I apply them in my daily work.

🚀 I'm currently working with BJSS, where I leverage my expertise in AWS cloud technologies and DevOps practices to deliver high-quality solutions.


-------------
*in my previous studies*

I am passionate about technology and the role it plays in enabling businesses to achieve their goals. I am excited to continue to grow my career in the field of DevOps and look forward to contributing to the success of future projects and teams.


I made this project as it my first projet in github just for fun, it allows me demonstrate my technical skill in cloud computing. Very soon I am going to upload several projects that will help me strengthen my ability of doing the right things at the right time. 

I will be assuming Hodan School as part of my project scenarios.
